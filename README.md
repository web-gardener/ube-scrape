# Scrape Template
### Requirements
 1. Do not modify `start.sh` or `src/entrypoint.sh`
 2. Install any required system/python packages by modifying `Dockerfile` and `environment.yml`
 3. Write all scraping code in `src/scrape.py`

### Testing
To build and run the scraper, simply run:
```
./start.sh
```
An `out.csv` file should be generated with the output of the scraper.
